        "\n",
        "2.BB is the most requested food. The hotel should maintain food quality while also offering discounts on other foods to promote other food types, reducing the burden on kitchen management and keeping a variety of food options available to customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.Most of the bookings are made through the online platform. Hotels can cut costs by eliminating market segments such as complementary and aviation because bookings through these segments are very low.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.Because most bookings made through TA/TO distribution are followed by corporate distribution, hotels should invest in both TA/TO and corporate distribution channels. The GDS distribution channel can be eliminated by hoteliers because bookings made through it are extremely low.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.Very few customers (3.86%) visited again. So hotels can increase repeat bookings by offering the right repeat booking incentives, understanding the motivations behind repeat bookings, marketing to your guests’ past interests, and assessing past bookings to identify priority guests.\n",

        "6.Because rooms A and D are the most popular with customers, the hotel should maintain their quality. The hotel should promote rooms E, F, and G to increase demand by offering discounts. Because customers do not prefer to book room types B, C, H, and L, the hotel can eliminate them, lowering the cost of these rooms.\n",

        "7.Customers do not want to pay a pre-deposit for a reservation. Hotels should promote advance deposits because not only does an advance deposit allow you to recognize revenue faster, it also greatly decreases the risk of cancellations.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.Because 3 and 8 parking spaces were rarely requested by customers, hotels can only keep bookings for 1 and 2 parking spaces to save money.\n",

        "\n",
        "9.Almost 25% of customers cancelled their bookings. Hotel should implement a cancellation policy, discount on confirmed bookings, and send booking reminders to guests to reduce booking cancellations.\n",

        "10.People typically book rooms for two people, so encourage family and group bookings. You can maximize revenue by promoting it with a discounted offer for group bookings."
